Hello That's The Stupid RPG.

I don't really know what I want to get from this project becouse that's just a learning project. I will put down some sources of this project into 
"readme".

Targest:
- To know how github works (That's my first repository)
- Make a simple RPG game from sourses and etc.
- And just have Fun!
